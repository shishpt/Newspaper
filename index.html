                    <p>Icelanders as far south as the Westman Islands were treated to an ambient display of the dancing Aurora Borealis. A phenomenon that was first spotted at 
                        21:00 and lasted well into the morning.  While this can be viewed in many countries around the world, the phenomenon has created an economical boom for
                        the tiny nation of 300,000.  The boom in companies newly created in the tourism sector has created an increase in employment throughout the country.</p>

                    <p>What was suppose to be a a simple walk along the pond Wednesday evening turned into sadness as Tomi Tomasson and his Psyduck were walking along 
                        Tjornin when it looked like Psyduck had a mental breakdown.  Little Tomi has no idea what led Psyduck to have such a reaction, however 
                        Psyduck ran along the pathway and into the downtown area.</p>

                    <p>Tomi and Psyduck have been the best of friends for many years however with Psyduck's recent lack of wins in Pokemon battles this might have led
                        to his mental breakdown.  If anyone has any information about the whereabouts of Psyduck they can contact Tomi's mom as Tomi is to young to have
                        a cell-phone.  <b>If you have any information about the whereabouts of Psyduck please call 555-5555.</b></p>

                    <p>The Faroe Islands appear suddenly, a jutting interruption in an endless carpet of rolling clouds. 
                        The plane circles the islands during the descent until everything is blotted out, the blue gradient 
                        of the sky and the jagged peaks vanishing into a churning greyscape. We’re spat out under the clouds, 
                        bumping down onto the runway and emerging into a muted summer landscape.  </p>
                    <p>Tórshavn, the islands’ capital city, is a forty minute drive away, through a distinctly miniature world. 
                        The villages we pass on the narrow coastal roads are mind-bendingly small. Most are a few streets of colourful houses, 
                        and perhaps a gas station, a store, and a football field, and then we’ve already left over a skinny bridge or through a 
                        rough-hewn tunnel towards the next one. </p>
