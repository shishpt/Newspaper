                    <p>Icelanders as far south as the greater Reykjavík area were delighted at the sight of the northern lights last Sunday evening. 
                        While many remarked that this seemed unusually early for them to make a return, in actuality the aurora borealis, as it is also known, 
                        do not really go anywhere the rest of the year—it’s just very hard to see them in the constant solar light of the summer.<br>
                        As we head into late August, darkness begins to return to Iceland; specifically, there is now darkness from between around 
                        22:00 and 05:00 this time of year. As such, there is now ample time to be able to witness the northern lights, provided solar activity and cloud cover cooperate.<br>
                        As Iceland’s cloud cover is notoriously mercurial, it is likely a good idea to check the Icelandic Met Office’s aurora forecast 
                        page before going hunting for the northern lights. This page details not only cloud cover forecasts, but also the predicted level 
                        of solar particle bombardment in the upper atmosphere that makes the lights possible.</p>

                    <p>What was suppose to be a a simple walk along the pond Wednesday evening turned into sadness as Tomi Tomasson and his Psyduck were walking along 
                        Tjornin when it looked like Psyduck had a mental breakdown.  Little Tomi has no idea what led Psyduck to have such a reaction, however 
                        Psyduck ran along the pathway and into the downtown area.</p>

                    <p>Tomi and Psyduck have been the best of friends for many years however with Psyduck's recent lack of wins in Pokemon battles this might have led
                        to his mental breakdown.  If anyone has any information about the whereabouts of Psyduck they can contact Tomi's mom as Tomi is to young to have
                        a cell-phone.  <b>If you have any information about the whereabouts of Psyduck please call 555-5555.</b></p>

                    <p>The Faroe Islands appear suddenly, a jutting interruption in an endless carpet of rolling clouds. 
                        The plane circles the islands during the descent until everything is blotted out, the blue gradient 
                        of the sky and the jagged peaks vanishing into a churning greyscape. We’re spat out under the clouds, 
                        bumping down onto the runway and emerging into a muted summer landscape.  </p>
                    <p>Tórshavn, the islands’ capital city, is a forty minute drive away, through a distinctly miniature world. 
                        The villages we pass on the narrow coastal roads are mind-bendingly small. Most are a few streets of colourful houses, 
                        and perhaps a gas station, a store, and a football field, and then we’ve already left over a skinny bridge or through a 
                        rough-hewn tunnel towards the next one. </p>
